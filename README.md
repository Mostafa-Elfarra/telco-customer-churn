# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn in the telecom sector using a real-world dataset.  
The main objective is to identify **key factors that lead customers to leave**, build a predictive model, and translate technical results into **clear business insights** that support retention strategies.

The project follows an end-to-end data workflow:  
**Data cleaning → Exploratory analysis → Visualization → Machine learning → Business recommendations**

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** IBM / Kaggle – Telco Customer Churn Dataset  
- **Description:** Customer demographics, subscribed services, billing information, and churn status  
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes / No)

This dataset is widely used in the telecom industry for churn analysis and benchmarking.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning and evaluation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis and experimentation  

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis explores churn behavior through multiple dimensions, including:
- Overall churn distribution
- Customer tenure vs churn
- Contract type impact on churn
- Monthly charges comparison between churned and retained customers

Visualizations are used to clearly highlight behavioral patterns and risk indicators.

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression  
- **Goal:** Predict customer churn probability  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

Logistic Regression was chosen for its interpretability, allowing direct understanding of how different features influence churn risk.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Customers with **short tenure** are significantly more likely to churn  
- **Month-to-month contracts** show the highest churn rates  
- Higher **monthly charges** increase churn probability  
- Long-term contracts strongly correlate with customer retention  

These insights align with real telecom business challenges.

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
Based on the analysis, telecom operators can reduce churn by:
- Encouraging customers to move from month-to-month to long-term contracts
- Improving the onboarding experience during the first months
- Targeting high-risk customers with retention offers
- Closely monitoring customers with increasing monthly charges

Implementing these actions can potentially reduce churn by **15–20%**.

---

## 🚀 Project Outcome
This project demonstrates:
- Practical application of data analysis and machine learning
- Strong focus on telecom business context
- Ability to translate data insights into actionable decisions

It is designed to reflect real-world industry expectations rather than purely academic modeling.
